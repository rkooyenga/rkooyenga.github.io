hierarchical git mess of fake news. Pop quiz how do you tell if somebody's facebook is real? How can you know if they're secretly running shady side businesses with cash embezzled from you? How can you find the weather for today where they live?

You could ask someone in russia, you could guess, you could call the criminally insane for advice, you could google them, or watch their girlfriends facebook and ctrl+f for instances of the word karaoke, you could do all of those things. Why you could even guess then have one of these other parties guess then tell each other what you think without admitting its a guess and then each of you with this new multitiered heap of dogshit, go and fill everyone elses head with this new double stuff horseshit. You could then make a new conclusion based on this retarded nonsense forget that half the shit you think you know is only because you made it up and didnt recognize it being fed back to you, from someone else you know, like not recognizing the taste of your own shit fed back to you. Then just go crazy with it, based on your own paranoid BS hang the person who's loyally been by your side and refusing to even say a cross word about you while he knows you are doing precisely what you are. because why? I don't know. it's not my game its charles' and hes got everyone playing. Me I'm just waiting to see if my batting avg for friends is a perfect zero, so far it is.
