This area and org hasn't been used much nor at all for years. But thats probably going to change and I'm likely going to build out a jekyll blog and revisit some old projects and discuss them here soon.

I have a LOT of git IDs to separate work projects over the years. Most are under aliases here and at BitBucket. And mostly from about 6 years ago where I was coding 12 hours a day.

I started this rkooyenga.github.io / Ray Kooyenga org account for a couple reasons. 9ne is theres virtually no work published under my real name despite all the projects I worked on for business privacy reasons. And so I thought I should throw a trinket or 2 on my name just so I'm not a total ghost.

There's a google search content / seo benefit here too as it will help push down some fake accounts on search pages that are not really me but rather things an old business partner put out there (fake WordPress, fake github, fake Facebook, fake LinkedIn, fake Twitter, etc). It's all over Google and we don't talk so I have no way to get him to remove that stuff or give me access to take over those accounts. Even now I'm using rkooyenga instead of raykooyenga @ github because...he has that too in my name. To be honest most of the social accounts and profiles I have setup in the past 5 years were literally an attempt to take back my name and o8ne reputation as the 1st 100 links on Google were all fake stuff about me that he controls. I'm a private person and with great reluctance and frustration was forced to setup accts solely to create any content at all.
