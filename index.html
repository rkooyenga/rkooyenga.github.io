<p>This area and org hasn’t been used much nor at all for years. But thats probably going to change and I’m likely going to build out a jekyll blog and revisit some old projects and discuss them here soon.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>note: i wrote this summary before the above content existed, so I’m clearly following thru :)*</p>
</blockquote>

<h4 id="personal-stuff">personal stuff</h4>
<p>I don’t code much anymore and retired from that sort of work after some traumatic life and business events. For years even looking at a computer made me twitch. I guess I have a form of PTSD which sounds extreme but if I were to explain what was done to me by some once close friends and business partners and just how bad my life got it would make sense. I’ll talk about it on some blog entries when I set that up. In the meantime I’m slowly trying to rebuild my life and overcome some of these psychological obstacles. As such I’m going to start slow by tinkering with and republishing here small simple stuff beginning with projects I did in the past as hobby fun stuff and not connected to old business projects which are difficult for me to look at and would cause problems if I re-associate myself with them publicly.</p>

<p>I feel good like I’m making some progress and hope to put some good content here soon. Probably going to do walk through on server / ssh hardening, aws-cli, twilio phone projects of which I’ve written a LOT assuming I regain access to my old twilio acct that stuff will be interesting I think. Bash scripts, some javascript stuff, building and managing your own VPN which I’ve been doing since 2013, maybe some chromebook hacking, all kinds of stuff.</p>

<h4 id="organization">organization</h4>
<p>I have a LOT of git IDs to separate work projects over the years. Most are under aliases here and at BitBucket. And mostly from about 6 years ago where I was coding 12 hours a day.</p>

<p>I started this rkooyenga.github.io / Ray Kooyenga org account for a couple reasons. One is theres virtually no work published under my real name despite all the projects I worked on for business privacy reasons. And so I thought I should throw a trinket or 2 on my name just so I’m not a total ghost.</p>

<p>Another benefit and the reason I made it an org is to be able to publish to it from other ids if even privately in order that i’d be able to use this area without logging out and back in.</p>

<h4 id="seo--reputation-management">SEO &amp; reputation management</h4>
<p>There’s also a huge google search content / seo benefit here too as it will help push down some fake accounts on search pages that are not really me but rather things an old business partner put out there (fake WordPress, fake github, fake Facebook, fake LinkedIn, fake Twitter, etc). It’s all over Google and we don’t talk so I have no way to get him to remove that stuff or give me access to take over those accounts. Even now I’m using rkooyenga instead of raykooyenga @ github because…he has that too in my name. To be honest most of the social accounts and profiles I have setup in the past 5 years were literally an attempt to take back my name and online reputation as the 1st 100 links on Google were all fake stuff about me that he controls. I’m a private person and with great reluctance and frustration was forced to setup accts solely to create any content at all.</p>

<p>Stay tuned and thanks for reading.</p>
