Hi! I'm Ray and this is my new Github Pages, one of them anyway. I'm an entrepreneur from Orange County. Former Adtech founder as well as some marketing/ad agencies over the years. I like the sunshine, the beach, and rock n roll. Also, I like coding stuff. Which is the function this site is meant to serve, helping to organize and talk about some projects. Like myself it's a work in progress and still being put together, populated with content. Working on it actively but alongside another personal site and many other projects. I'm fairly active on [CodePen](//codepen.io/deadflowers) as well as X [X](//x.com/@rayktweets).

Thanks for checking this area out!
